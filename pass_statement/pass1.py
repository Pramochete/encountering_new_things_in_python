'''pass is a null statement. We generally use it as a placeholder. 
   Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, 
   but we want to implement it in the future. They cannot have an empty body. 
   The interpreter would complain. So, we use the pass statement to construct a body that does nothing.
